## Amaranta Learn

Amaranta Learn is a web-based landing page developed for Final Project 2 in the Web Developer Program at PT Hacktivate Teknologi Indonesia, representing a fictional education platform. It provides learning materials and tryouts for the UTBK, Indonesia’s standardized test for state university admissions. This project was built by following a predefined user interface design, requiring careful implementation of layout and responsiveness. The result is a clean, educational-focused landing page that demonstrates the ability to translate design mockups into fully functional, responsive web experiences.
